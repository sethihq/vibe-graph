> "It's so over" / "We're so back" - An animated sine wave visualization of emotional volatility

## 🎯 About

VibeGraph is a minimalist, frontend-only web app that visualizes emotional volatility through an animated sine wave. Inspired by the popular "It's so over / We're so back" meme, it displays a continuously animated graph that gets faster and more chaotic over time, mimicking increasing emotional instability.

## ✨ Features

- **Real-time animated sine wave** that increases in frequency and chaos over time
- **Responsive design** that works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Minimalist aesthetic** inspired by Dieter Rams design principles
- **Interactive mood generation** with a single button click
- **Visual feedback** with a moving dot that tracks the current emotional state
- **Auto-reset cycle** every 20 seconds for continuous entertainment

## 🛠 Technologies

- **Next.js 15** with App Router
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for styling
- **Framer Motion** for smooth animations
- **SVG** for crisp graph rendering

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the magic happen!

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- **Neutral color palette** with paper gray background (#f4f4f4)
- **Inter font** for clean UI text
- **JetBrains Mono** for graph labels and technical elements
- **Subtle animations** that enhance rather than distract
- **Full-screen centered layout** with no unnecessary chrome

## 🎮 How It Works

1. The wave starts calm and predictable
2. Every 3 seconds, frequency and chaos increase
3. The background subtly shifts as emotions intensify
4. After 20 seconds, everything resets and starts over
5. Click "Generate Mood" for a random emotional state

## 📱 Responsive Features

- Graph automatically scales for mobile devices
- Touch-friendly button sizing
- Optimized text sizing for different screen sizes
- Prevents horizontal scrolling
